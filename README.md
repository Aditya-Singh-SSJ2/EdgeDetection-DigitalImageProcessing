## **Overview**  

Edge detection is a cornerstone of image processing, enabling the identification of boundaries and shapes in visual data. This repository demonstrates:  
1. **Basic Kernels** for operations like:  
   - **Vertical Edge Detection**  
   - **Horizontal Edge Detection**  
   - **Outline Detection**  
   - **Embossing Effects**  

2. **Gradient-Based Operators**:  
   - **Sobel**: Accurate gradient approximation with smoothing.  
   - **Prewitt**: Simpler gradient operator.  
   - **Roberts Cross**: Diagonal gradients for sharp edge detection.  

3. **Gaussian-Based Operators**:  
   - **Canny Edge Detector**: Multi-stage algorithm for precise edge detection with noise reduction.  
   - **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**: Combines Gaussian smoothing with second derivatives to detect edges.

## **Features**  

- **Comprehensive Examples**:  
  Each operator is implemented using Python and OpenCV2, complete with explanations and visualizations.  

- **Predefined Kernels**:  
  This repo includes custom kernel matrices for basic edge detection (e.g., vertical, horizontal) and creative effects like embossing.  

- **Code for Visualizing Results**:  
  Quickly compare the effects of different edge detection methods on sample images.  

- **Ease of Use**:  
  Modular scripts to help you plug in your images and see results instantly.
